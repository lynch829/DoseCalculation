function [ output_args ] = TERMA( E,r)
% Function to calculate total energy released per unit mass(TERMA)
%   D=
% TERMA is energy fluence times mass attenuation coefficient
% Energy fluence is fluence times energy for mono-energetic beams, integral
% of the energy times fluence of each energy for poly-energetic beams
